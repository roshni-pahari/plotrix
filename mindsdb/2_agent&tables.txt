-- Step 6: Create an Agent Bot for movie Q&A
-- This agent responds to user questions about specific movies using a detailed prompt.
-- Replace <your_openai_api_key> with your own valid API key.

CREATE AGENT plotrix_bot
USING
  model = 'gpt-4o',
  openai_api_key = '<your_openai_api_key>',
  prompt_template = '
You are a knowledgeable film expert who understands global cinema deeply.

A user is asking about the movie titled "{{title}}" released in {{release_year}} from {{origin}}.

Movie Description:
{{plot}}

User’s Question:
"{{question}}"

Respond insightfully and specifically, referencing the plot, origin, release year, genre, and cinematic context. Avoid vague or generic replies. Keep it short.

------------------------------------------------------------

-- Optional: Drop the agent if you need to recreate or update it
DROP AGENT IF EXISTS plotrix_bot;

-- Example: Use the Agent to answer a question about a specific movie
SELECT answer
FROM plotrix_bot
WHERE
  title = 'Inception'
  AND plot = 'A skilled thief who enters dreams to steal secrets but must plant an idea instead.'
  AND origin = 'American'

-- Step 7: Create an AI Table Model to enrich movie metadata
-- This model predicts detailed movie insights like director, rating, awards, etc.
-- Replace <your_openai_api_key> with your own valid API key.

CREATE MODEL movie_info
PREDICT response
INPUT title, plot, genre, origin, release_year

  engine = 'openai',
  model_name = 'gpt-4o',
  openai_api_key = '<your_openai_api_key>',

------------------------------------------------------------

-- Optional: Drop the model if needed
DROP MODEL IF EXISTS movie_info;

-- Example: Query the model to generate enriched information about a movie
SELECT response
FROM movie_info
WHERE
  title = 'Inception'
  AND plot = 'A skilled thief who enters dreams to steal secrets but must plant an idea instead.'
  AND genre = 'Sci-Fi, Action'
